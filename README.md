ðŸ”¥ Fire-Fighting Robot using ESP32

An autonomous fire-fighting robot that detects fire and gas leaks, navigates to the source, and extinguishes the fire while sending SMS alerts to the user. This IoT-enabled robot is powered by the ESP32 microcontroller and is designed for educational and safety applications.

ðŸ”¥ Fire detection using flame sensors

ðŸ§ª Gas/smoke detection using MQ2 sensor

ðŸš— Autonomous movement using L298N motor driver

ðŸ’§ Water pump controlled via relay module

ðŸŽ¯ Nozzle aiming using SG90 servo motor

ðŸ”‹ Efficient power control using LM2596 buck converter

ðŸ§  How It Works
Detection: Flame and gas sensors monitor the surroundings for fire or gas leaks.

Alert: Upon detection, an SMS alert is sent.

Movement: The robot navigates toward the fire location using motor drivers.

Targeting: Servo motor aims the nozzle at the fire.

Extinguishing: The relay activates the water pump to put out the fire.
